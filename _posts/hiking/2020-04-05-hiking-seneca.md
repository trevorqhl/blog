One of my best kept hiking secrets Seneca Colleage in King Campus. It offes the experience old growth forests, rolling hills, meadows, 
wetlands and the historic pathways of Eaton Hall. Don't forget to enjoy some quality time staying at the back of Eaton Hall Inn & Conference Centre 
and overlooking Lake Seneca. The hike is about one hour around the Lake.
